## What is Regression Testing?

Imagine you’re updating your software—fixing a bug or adding a new feature—but suddenly, something that worked perfectly before stops functioning. That’s what regression testing is here to prevent! Regression testing involves re-running existing test cases to ensure that recent changes haven’t introduced any new bugs or broken existing features. It’s like double-checking your work to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks.

## Why is Regression Testing Important?

Why does regression testing matter? Because software is complex, and even small changes can have unintended consequences. Without regression testing, you risk delivering a buggy product that could frustrate your users or even cause critical failures. Regular regression testing keeps your software stable and ensures a reliable user experience.
